# Chapter 2 — Clarify Values and Constraints Using AI

In this chapter, you will learn how to identify your personal values, priorities, and life constraints. Clarifying these is essential before you design experiments and take meaningful actions.

**Topics covered:**
- Understanding what truly matters to you
- Recognizing constraints that affect decisions
- Using AI to generate insights about your values
- Practical exercises to prioritize your life goals

### Example Exercise:
1. List 5 things that are most important to you in life.
2. Identify any constraints like time, finances, or responsibilities.
3. Ask AI to suggest ways to align daily actions with your core values.

**Reflection:**  
Take note of what matters most and what limits your choices. This will guide all your life experiments and decisions in later chapters.
