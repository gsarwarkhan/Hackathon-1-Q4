# Chapter 8 — Building a Portfolio and Small Income Streams

Once you have experimented and developed skills, it’s time to showcase your work and generate small income streams. A portfolio allows you to demonstrate capability, while micro-income projects validate skills in real-world settings.

**Topics covered:**
- Importance of building a personal portfolio  
- How to select projects to showcase  
- Generating small income streams through micro-projects or freelance work  
- Using AI to optimize your portfolio and suggest monetization opportunities  

### Example Exercise:
1. Choose 2–3 experiments or projects you’ve completed that can be added to a portfolio.  
2. Document each project: goals, process, results, and learnings.  
3. Ask AI to suggest ways to present your portfolio professionally.  
4. Explore potential micro-income ideas aligned with your skills and portfolio.  

**Reflection:**  
Your portfolio is both a reflection of your growth and a tool to unlock opportunities. Small income streams provide feedback and validation for your experiments.
