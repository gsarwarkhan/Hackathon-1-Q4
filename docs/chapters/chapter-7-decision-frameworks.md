# Chapter 7 — Decision Frameworks and Weighted Experiments

As you progress through life experiments, you’ll face multiple options and choices. Using structured decision frameworks helps you make informed decisions and prioritize high-impact experiments.

**Topics covered:**
- Introduction to decision frameworks for personal growth  
- How to assign weights to options based on values, resources, and impact  
- Using AI to analyze and rank options  
- Combining weighted experiments with rapid prototyping  

### Example Exercise:
1. List 3–5 possible experiments or projects you want to try next.  
2. Assign weights to each based on value alignment, resources needed, and expected impact.  
3. Use AI to calculate scores and suggest the most promising options.  
4. Decide which experiment to start next and plan your steps.  

**Reflection:**  
Weighted decision-making helps you focus on experiments that maximize learning and progress while respecting your constraints.
# Chapter 7 Prompts — Decision Frameworks

## Purpose:
Use AI to evaluate options and prioritize life experiments effectively.

## Prompts:
1. "Analyze my list of experiments and rank them based on values, resources, and expected impact."
2. "Suggest a weighted scoring system to prioritize my life experiments."
3. "Recommend which experiment I should focus on next and why."
4. "Provide alternative decision frameworks I can use for life choices."
