# Chapter 4 — Ideation: Generate Life and Career Experiments

Once you understand your values and current situation, it’s time to brainstorm ideas for life and career experiments. Ideation is about generating as many options as possible and then filtering them based on your goals.

**Topics covered:**
- Principles of ideation for personal growth  
- How AI can help generate creative life and career experiments  
- Shortlisting ideas based on your values, skills, and resources  
- Examples of micro-experiments to try  

### Example Exercise:
1. Ask AI to generate 10–15 life or career experiments aligned with your top values.  
2. Review the list and select 3 experiments that excite you most.  
3. Define simple ways to test each experiment.  

**Reflection:**  
The goal is not perfection—it's to generate actionable ideas and test them quickly.
