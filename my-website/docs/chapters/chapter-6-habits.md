# Chapter 6 — Habit Design and Microprojects with AI

Once you have tested life experiments, it’s time to embed learning into daily habits and small projects. Habit design ensures that experiments lead to long-term changes, while microprojects allow you to make progress without feeling overwhelmed.

**Topics covered:**
- Principles of habit formation for personal growth  
- Designing microprojects aligned with your goals  
- Using AI to track habits, suggest microtasks, and optimize routines  
- Combining habits and experiments for maximum impact  

### Example Exercise:
1. Choose one key habit that supports your life goals.  
2. Break it into small, actionable daily steps (microprojects).  
3. Use AI to track progress, suggest reminders, and optimize routines.  
4. Reflect weekly on how habits and microprojects contribute to your goals.  

**Reflection:**  
Consistency and small wins are more important than perfection. Microprojects make big goals achievable and habits stick over time.
