# Chapter 3 — Personal Audit: Skills, Resources, and Environment

Before designing experiments for your life, it’s important to understand where you currently stand. A personal audit helps you map your skills, resources, and environment to make smarter decisions.

**Topics covered:**
- Identifying your key skills and strengths  
- Auditing your resources: time, finances, network  
- Recognizing environmental factors that can help or limit you  
- Using AI to visualize your current state and potential  

### Example Exercise:
1. List your top 5 skills and strengths.  
2. Map available resources: hours per week, money, tools, connections.  
3. Note environmental factors: opportunities, constraints, challenges.  
4. Ask AI to suggest experiments that fit your current situation.  

**Reflection:**  
Understanding your starting point ensures that your life experiments are realistic, achievable, and aligned with your goals.
